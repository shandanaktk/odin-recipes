        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.
            Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the 
            plural. The name is believed to come from a Latin word for cooking pot, lasanum, though some etymologies 
            trace it to the Greek flatbread called laganon, known in Italy since at least the time of Augustus Caesar 
            (63 BCE−14 CE). Lasagna in its modern form, made of a meat sauce much like ragù Bolognese that is layered 
            with noodles and béchamel (besciamella or balsamella) sauce, is believed to have originated in the province
            of Emilia-Romagna. Variations abound throughout Italy: the lasagna served in Naples, for example, usually 
            contains small meatballs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sliced hard-boiled eggs, while that served 
            in Genoa uses pesto as its sauce. Some recipes use sausage as well as other types of ground meat; others 
            incorporate mushrooms into the ragù.

            Making lasagna is a more labour-intensive process than that required of most other pastas. 
            The lasagna noodles are cooked al dente (firm but not hard) and then drained and cooled, 
            so they can be handled. In an ovenproof dish, a layer of tomato sauce is spooned in and then 
            overlaid lengthwise by a layer of overlapping noodles. To this are added layers of meat sauce, 
            cheese, béchamel, or other ingredients, overlaid by another layer of noodles, and repeated. 
            Italian chefs hold that a lasagna must have a minimum of three layers of noodles, though four 
            layers are more common. The assembled lasagna is then baked at 350 °F (180 °C) for about half an 
            hour. In order to keep the lasagna moist as it cooks, most chefs place a covering of aluminum foil 
            over the dish.
