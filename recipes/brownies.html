        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a 
            variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, 
            but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, 
            chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than 
            chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the 
            United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 
            20th century.
            Brownies are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with ice 
            cream (Ã  la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North 
            America, they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants, ice cream 
            parlors and coffeehouses.

            One legend about the creation of brownies is that of Bertha Palmer, a prominent Chicago socialite 
            whose husband owned the Palmer House Hotel.[1] In 1893, Palmer asked a pastry chef for a dessert 
            suitable for ladies attending the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. She requested a cake-like 
            confection smaller than a piece of cake that could be included in boxed lunches.[2] The result was
            the Palmer House Brownie, made of chocolate with walnuts and an apricot glaze. The modern Palmer 
            House Hotel serves a dessert to patrons made from the same recipe.[3] The name was given to the 
            dessert some time after 1893, but was not used by cook books or journals at the time.
